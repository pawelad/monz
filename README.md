Simple (and awesome) command line interface for quickly accessing your
(equally awesome) Monzo account info, its current balance, latest transactions,
etc.

It uses [pymonzo][pymonzo] and its authentication system in the background so
you should to read the [auth section][pymonzo auth section] there first.

## Installation
From PyPI:

```
$ pip install monz
```

## Usage
First, you need to authenticate either via an
[access token][pymonzo access token] or [OAuth 2][pymonzo oauth2].

Everything else should be pretty straightforward:

```
$ monz --help 
Usage: monz [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Simple command line interface for quickly accessing your Monzo account
  info, current balance, latest transactions, etc.

  See https://github.com/pawelad/monz for more info.

Options:
  -t, --access-token TEXT  Monzo API access token.
  --help                   Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  info*         Show your Monzo basic info
  accounts      Show connected Monzo accounts
  balance       Show Monzo account balance
  transactions  Show Monzo account transactions
```

## Examples
The default subcommand is `info` which shows your account balance and its
latest transaction:

```
$ monz  
Balance:     £17.29
Spent today: £0.00

-£50.00 | Robot Arms Apartments (New New York)
Category:    Bills
Date:        Nov 18, 3016 11:09 PM

$ monz info  
Balance:     £17.29
Spent today: £0.00

-£50.00 | Robot Arms Apartments (New New York)
Category:    Bills
Date:        Nov 18, 3016 11:09 PM

```

You can view your linked accounts:

```
$ monz accounts    
Account #1, Bender Rodríguez
ID:          acc_2716057
Created:     Dec 31, 2999 11:59 PM
```

If you have only one then it will become the default one, but if you have more
then you have to pass its ID explicitly to other subcommands.

You can also view your current balance:

```
$ monz balance
Balance:     £17.29
Spent today: £0.00
```

Finally, you can see your latest transactions:

```
$ monz transactions -n 2
